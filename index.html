<h1>An Analysis of the Impact Engine Cylinders has on MPG</h1>
<p>This website is dedicated to exploring the impact that engine cylinders have on a car's miles per gallon (mpg). The two types of mpg
that will be analyzed here are AverageHighwayMPG (gas mileage of a car when they continuously drive at a high speed) and 
AverageCityMPG (gas mileage of a car when they are in start and stop traffic). We invite the user to explore this web page further 
to discover the impact that a higher number of engine cylinders has on these two statistics, as well as how a higher number of engine
cylinders affect the difference between the two values. Click on the button below to proceed to the first chart.</p>
